  <p><strong>Step 1: crack the eggs into a pan with oil</strong> <br>
    Make sure to start slowly scrambling the eggs on low fire until it's all scrambled.<br>

    <strong>Step 2: add the rice</strong> <br>
    Slowly add the block of rice into the pan and start breaking it apart into the eggs.<br>

    <strong>Step 3: add the oyster sauce</strong>
    Just plop the sauce in there and slowly stir it in. <br> 

    <strong>Step 4: add the taiwanese sausage</strong>
    I just dump the taiwanese sausage in there and let it settle in there on low heat in the rice. <br>

    <strong>Stpe 5: sprinkle some white pepper and enjoy!</strong>
    Yay we're done! It should have taken you like 6-7 minutes. <br>
